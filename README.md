kana
====

This is a simple CLI utility to help drill kana (both katakana and hiragana).

## Installation ##

You must have golang installed (see: [https://golang.org/install](https://golang.org/install))

Then you can simply install with `go get`

```bash
> go get github.com/wcharczuk/kana
```

## Usage

The CLI will ask you to give the romanized versions of a random kana character.

See the source file for the correct answers, but typically it's somewhere from 1-3 latin ascii characters as a correct answer.
